    "You own a chain of scooter rental stations called Scooters Get You There. There are 20 locations in the center of the city and each one has a maximum of 50 electric scooters. You want to test the hypothesis that in the past month there were on average 30 scooters available at any station during the day. An urban group called 'Squirrel' highlighted the importance of this number in their study of resident mobility. (If there are fewer scooters at the station, users will think that they won’t be able to rent one when they need one—but when there are more, people think that they won’t be able to dock their scooter after a trip because there won’t be any free spaces.)\n",
